# Introduction

The motivation for this package is to provide functions which help with the
development and tuning of machine learning models in biomedical data where the
sample size is frequently limited, but the number of predictors may be
significantly larger (P >> n). While most machine learning pipelines involve
splitting data into training and testing cohorts, typically 2/3 and 1/3
respectively. Medical datasets may be too small for this, and so determination
of accuracy in the left-out test set suffers because the test set is small.
Nested cross-validation (CV) provides a way to get round this, by maximising use
of the whole dataset for testing overall accuracy, while maintaining the split
between training and testing.

In addition typical biomedical datasets often have many 10,000s of possible
predictors, so filtering of predictors is commonly needed. However, it has been
demonstrated that filtering on the whole dataset creates a bias when determining
accuracy of model (Vabalas et al, 2019). Thus, it is recommended that any
filtering of predictors is performed within the CV loops, to prevent data
leakage.

This package enables nested cross-validation (CV) to be performed using the
commonly used `glmnet` package, which fits elastic net regression models, and
the `caret` package, which is a general framework for fitting a large number of
machine learning models. In addition, `nestedcv` adds functionality to enable
cross-validation of the elastic net alpha parameter when fitting `glmnet`
models.

`nestedcv` partitions the dataset into outer and inner folds (default 10x10
folds). The inner fold CV, (default is 10-fold), is used to tune optimal
hyperparameters for models. Then the model is fitted on the whole inner fold and
tested on the left-out data from the outer fold. This repeated across all outer
folds (default 10 outer folds), and the unseen test predictions from the outer
folds are compared against the true results for the outer test folds and the
results concatenated, to give measures of accuracy (e.g. AUC and accuracy for
classification, or RMSE for regression) across the whole dataset.

Finally, the tuning parameters for each model in the outer folds are averaged to
give the mean best parameters across all outer folds. A final model is fitted
across the whole data using these final hyperparameters and can be used for
prediction with external data.

### Variable selection

While some models such as `glmnet` allow for sparsity and have variable
selection built-in, many models fail to fit when given massive numbers of
predictors, or perform poorly due to overfitting without variable selection. In
addition, in medicine one of the goals of predictive modelling is commonly the
development of diagnostic or biomarker tests, for which reducing the number of
predictors is typically a practical necessity.

Several filter functions (t-test, Wilcoxon test, anova, Pearson/Spearman
correlation, random forest variable importance, and ReliefF from the `CORElearn`
package) for feature selection are provided, and can be embedded within the
outer loop of the nested CV.

# Examples

### Importance of nested CV

The following simulated example demonstrates the bias intrinsic to datasets where *P* >>
*n* when applying filtering of predictors to the whole dataset rather than to
training folds.

```{r}
## Example binary classification problem with P >> n
x <- matrix(rnorm(150 * 2e+04), 150, 2e+04)  # predictors
y <- factor(rbinom(150, 1, 0.5))  # binary response

## Partition data into 2/3 training set, 1/3 test set
trainSet <- caret::createDataPartition(y, p = 0.66, list = FALSE)

## t-test filter using whole test set
filt <- ttest_filter(y, x, nfilter = 100)
filx <- x[, filt]

## Train glmnet on training set only using filtered predictor matrix
library(glmnet)
fit <- cv.glmnet(filx[trainSet, ], y[trainSet], family = "binomial")

## Predict response on test set
predy <- predict(fit, newx = filx[-trainSet, ], s = "lambda.min", type = "class")
predy <- as.vector(predy)
predyp <- predict(fit, newx = filx[-trainSet, ], s = "lambda.min", type = "response")
predyp <- as.vector(predyp)
output <- data.frame(testy = y[-trainSet], predy = predy, predyp = predyp)

## Results on test set
## shows bias since univariate filtering was applied to whole dataset
predSummary(output)

## Nested CV
fit2 <- nestcv.glmnet(y, x, family = "binomial", alphaSet = 7:10 / 10,
                      filterFUN = ttest_filter,
                      filter_options = list(nfilter = 100))
fit2

testroc <- pROC::roc(output$testy, output$predyp, direction = "<", quiet = TRUE)
inroc <- innercv_roc(fit2)
plot(fit2$roc)
lines(inroc, col = 'blue')
lines(testroc, col = 'red')
legend('bottomright', legend = c("Nested CV", "Left-out inner CV folds", 
                                 "Test partition, non-nested filtering"), 
       col = c("black", "blue", "red"), lty = 1, lwd = 2, bty = "n")
```

Here the dataset is pure noise. Filtering of predictors on the whole dataset is
a source of leakage of information about the test set, leading to substantially
overoptimistic performance on the test set as measured by ROC AUC.

### Nested CV with glmnet

In the real life example below, RNA-Sequencing gene expression data from
synovial biopsies from patients with rheumatoid arthritis in the R4RA randomised
clinical trial (Humby et al, 2021) is used to predict clinical response to the
biologic drug rituximab. Treatment response is determined by a clinical measure,
namely Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 50% response, which has a binary
outcome: treatment success or failure (response or non-response). This dataset
contains gene expression on over 50,000 genes in arthritic synovial tissue from
133 individuals, who were randomised to two drugs (rituximab and tocilizumab).
First, we remove genes of low expression using a median cut-off (this still
leaves >16,000 genes), and we subset the dataset to the rituximab treated
individuals (n=68).

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Raw RNA-Seq data for this example is located at:
# https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-11611/

# set up data
load("/../R4RA_270821.RData")

index <- r4ra.meta$Outliers_Detected_On_PCA != "outlier" & r4ra.meta$Visit == 3 
          & !is.na(r4ra.meta$Visit)
metadata <- r4ra.meta[index, ]
dim(metadata)  # 133 individuals

medians <- Rfast::rowMedians(as.matrix(r4ra.vst))
data <- t(as.matrix(r4ra.vst))
# remove low expressed genes
data <- data[index, medians > 6]  
dim(data)  # 16254 genes

# Rituximab cohort only
yrtx <- metadata$CDAI.response.status.V7[metadata$Randomised.medication == "Rituximab"]
yrtx <- factor(yrtx)
data.rtx <- data[metadata$Randomised.medication == "Rituximab", ]

# no filter
res.rtx <- nestcv.glmnet(y = yrtx, x = data.rtx,
                         family = "binomial", cv.cores = 8,
                         alphaSet = seq(0.7, 1, 0.05))
res.rtx
```

Use `summary()` to see full information from the nested model fitting. `coef()`
can be used to show the coefficients of the final fitted model.
Filters can be used by setting the `filterFUN` argument. Options for the filter 
function are passed as a list through `filter_options`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# t-test filter
res.rtx <- nestcv.glmnet(y = yrtx, x = data.rtx, filterFUN = ttest_filter,
                         filter_options = list(nfilter = 300, p_cutoff = NULL),
                         family = "binomial", cv.cores = 8,
                         alphaSet = seq(0.7, 1, 0.05))
summary(res.rtx)
```

Output from the nested CV with glmnet can be plotted to show how deviance is 
affected by alpha and lambda.

```{r eval = FALSE}
plot_alphas(res.rtx)
plot_lambdas(res.rtx)
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_alpha_lam.png")
```

The tuning of alpha for each outer fold can be plotted.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Fold 1 line plot
plot(res.rtx$outer_result[[1]]$cvafit)

# Scatter plot
plot(res.rtx$outer_result[[1]]$cvafit, type = 'p')

# Number of non-zero coefficients
plot(res.rtx$outer_result[[1]]$cvafit, xaxis = 'nvar')
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("plot_cva.png")
```

ROC curves from left-out folds from both outer and inner CV can be plotted. Note
that the AUC based on the left-out outer folds is the unbiased estimate of
accuracy, while the left-out inner folds demonstrate bias due to the
optimisation of the model's hyperparameters on the inner fold data.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Outer CV ROC
plot(res.rtx$roc, main = "Outer fold ROC", font.main = 1, col = 'blue')
legend("bottomright", legend = paste0("AUC = ", signif(pROC::auc(res.rtx$roc), 3)), bty = 'n')

# Inner CV ROC
rtx.inroc <- innercv_roc(res.rtx)
plot(rtx.inroc, main = "Inner fold ROC", font.main = 1, col = 'red')
legend("bottomright", legend = paste0("AUC = ", signif(pROC::auc(rtx.inroc), 3)), bty = 'n')
```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("roc.png")
```

The overall expression level of each gene selected in the final model can be 
compared with a boxplot.

```{r eval = FALSE}
boxplot_model(res.rtx, data.rtx, ylab = "VST")
```

```{r, out.width='70%', fig.align="center", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("boxplot.png")
```

Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) can be performed on the outer folds.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Outer LOOCV
res.rtx <- nestcv.glmnet(y = yrtx, x = data.rtx, min_1se = 0, filterFUN = ttest_filter,
                         filter_options = list(nfilter = 300, p_cutoff = NULL),
                         outer_method = "LOOCV",
                         family = "binomial", cv.cores = 8,
                         alphaSet = seq(0.7, 1, 0.05))
summary(res.rtx)
```

### Filters

Multiple filters are available including:

----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
`ttest_filter`    t-test

`wilcoxon_filter` Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test

`anova_filter`    one-way ANOVA

`correl_filter`   Pearson or Spearman correlation for regression modelling

`lm_filter`       linear model with covariates

`rf_filter`       random forest variable importance

`relieff_filter`  ReliefF and other methods available via CORElearn
----------------- ---------------------------------------------------------

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Random forest filter
res.rtx <- nestcv.glmnet(y = yrtx, x = data.rtx, min_1se = 0.5, filterFUN = rf_filter,
                         filter_options = list(nfilter = 300),
                         family = "binomial", cv.cores = 8, 
                         alphaSet = seq(0.7, 1, 0.05))
summary(res.rtx)

# ReliefF algorithm filter
res.rtx <- nestcv.glmnet(y = yrtx, x = data.rtx, min_1se = 0, filterFUN = relieff_filter,
                         filter_options = list(nfilter = 300),
                         family = "binomial", cv.cores = 8, 
                         alphaSet = seq(0.7, 1, 0.05))
summary(res.rtx)
```

### Custom filter

It is fairly straightforward to create your own custom filter, which can be
embedded within the outer CV loops via `nestcv.glmnet`, `nestcv.train` or
`outercv`. The function simply must be of the form

```{r eval = FALSE}
filter <- function(y, x, ...) {}
```

Other arguments can be passed in to the filter function as a named list via the
`filter_options` argument. The function must return a vector of indices of those
predictors in `x` which are to be retained for downstream model fitting as well
as prediction on left-out outer folds. Importantly the filter function is
applied independently to each outer CV fold and not run on the whole data.

Finally once the model performance has been calculated by nested CV. The filter
is applied to the whole dataset when refitting the final model to the full
dataset.

### Nested CV with caret

Nested CV can also be performed using the `caret` package framework written by
Max Kuhn (https://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html). This enables access to the
large library of machine learning models available within caret.

Here we use `caret` for tuning the alpha and lambda parameters of `glmnet`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# nested CV using caret
tg <- expand.grid(lambda = exp(seq(log(2e-3), log(1e0), length.out = 100)),
                  alpha = seq(0.8, 1, 0.1))
ncv <- nestcv.train(y = yrtx, x = data.rtx,
               method = "glmnet",
               savePredictions = "final",
               filterFUN = ttest_filter, filter_options = list(nfilter = 300),
               tuneGrid = tg, cv.cores = 8)
ncv$summary

# Plot ROC on outer folds
plot(ncv$roc)

# Plot ROC on inner LO folds
inroc <- innercv_roc(ncv)
plot(inroc)
pROC::auc(inroc)

# Extract coefficients of final fitted model
glmnet_coefs(ncv$final_fit$finalModel, s = ncv$finalTune$lambda)
```

### Notes on caret

It is important to realise that the `train()` function in `caret` sets a
parameter known as `tuneLength` to 3 by default, so the default tuning grid is
minimal. `tuneLength` can easily be increased to give a tuning grid of greater
granularity. Tuneable parameters for individual models can be inspected using
`modelLookup()`, while `getModelInfo()` gives further information.

When fitting classification models, the usual default metric for tuning model
hyperparameters in `caret` is Accuracy. However, with small datasets, accuracy
is disproportionately affected by changes in a single individual's prediction
outcome from incorrect to correctly classified or vice versa. For this reason,
we suggest using logLoss with smaller datasets as it provides more stable
measures of model tuning behaviour. In `nestedcv`, when fitting classification
models with `caret`, the default metric is changed to use logLoss.

We recommend that the results of tuning are plotted to understand whether
parameters have a systematic effect on model accuracy. With small datasets
tuning may pick parameters partially at random because of random fluctuations in
measured accuracy during tuning, which may worsen noise surrounding performance
than if they were fixed.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Example tuning plot for outer fold 1
plot(ncv$outer_result[[1]]$fit, xTrans = log)

# ggplot2 version
ggplot(ncv$outer_result[[1]]$fit) +
  scale_x_log10() 
```

### Making predictions

For all of the nestedcv model training functions described above, predictions on
new data can be made by referencing the final fitted object which is fitted to
the whole dataset.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# for nestcv.glmnet object
preds <- predict(res.rtx, newdata = data.rtx, type = 'response')

# for nestcv.train object
preds <- predict(ncv, newdata = data.rtx)
```

# CV with hsstan

### Linear regression with hsstan (continuous outcome)

```{r}
# Cross-validation is used to apply univariate filtering of predictors.
# only one CV split is needed (outercv) as the Bayesian model does not require
# learning of meta-parameters.

# load iris dataset and simulate a continuous outcome
data(iris)
dt <- iris[, 1:4]
colnames(dt) <- c("marker1", "marker2", "marker3", "marker4")
dt <- as.data.frame(apply(dt, 2, scale))
dt$outcome.cont <- -3 + 0.5 * dt$marker1 + 2 * dt$marker2 + rnorm(nrow(dt), 0, 2)

# unpenalised covariates: always retain in the prediction model
uvars <- "marker1"
# penalised covariates: coefficients are drawn from hierarchical shrinkage prior
pvars <- c("marker2", "marker3", "marker4") # penalised covariates
# run cross-validation with univariate filter and hsstan
oldopt <- options(mc.cores=2)  # to pass CRAN package checks
res.cv.hsstan <- outercv(y = dt$outcome.cont, x = dt[, c(uvars, pvars)],
                         model = model.hsstan,
                         filterFUN = lm_filter,
                         filter_options = list(force_vars = uvars,
                                               nfilter = 2,
                                               p_cutoff = NULL,
                                               rsq_cutoff = 0.9),
                         n_outer_folds = 3,
                         unpenalized = uvars, warmup = 1000, iter = 2000)
# view prediction performance based on testing folds
summary(res.cv.hsstan)

# load hsstan package to examine the Bayesian model
library(hsstan)
sampler.stats(res.cv.hsstan$final_fit)
print(projsel(res.cv.hsstan$final_fit), digits = 4)  # adding marker2
```

Here adding `marker2` improves the model fit: substantial decrease of
KL-divergence from the full model to the submodel. Adding `marker3` does not
improve the model fit: no decrease of KL-divergence from the full model to the
submodel.

### Logistic regression with hsstan (binary outcome)

Cross-validation is used to apply univariate filtering of predictors.
only one CV split is needed (outercv) as the Bayesian model does not require
learning of meta-parameters.

```{r}
# sigmoid function
sigmoid <- function(x) {1 / (1 + exp(-x))}

# load iris dataset and create a binary outcome
set.seed(267)
data(iris)
dt <- iris[, 1:4]
colnames(dt) <- c("marker1", "marker2", "marker3", "marker4")
dt <- as.data.frame(apply(dt, 2, scale))
rownames(dt) <- paste0("sample", c(1:nrow(dt)))
dt$outcome.bin <- sigmoid(0.5 * dt$marker1 + 2 * dt$marker2) > runif(nrow(dt))
dt$outcome.bin <- factor(dt$outcome.bin)


# unpenalised covariates: always retain in the prediction model
uvars <- "marker1"
# penalised covariates: coefficients are drawn from hierarchical shrinkage prior
pvars <- c("marker2", "marker3", "marker4") # penalised covariates
# run cross-validation with univariate filter and hsstan
res.cv.hsstan <- outercv(y = dt$outcome.bin,
                         x = as.matrix(dt[, c(uvars, pvars)]),
                         model = model.hsstan,
                         filterFUN = ttest_filter,
                         filter_options = list(force_vars = uvars,
                                               nfilter = 2,
                                               p_cutoff = NULL,
                                               rsq_cutoff = 0.9),
                         n_outer_folds = 3,
                         unpenalized = uvars, warmup = 1000, iter = 2000)


# view prediction performance based on testing folds
summary(res.cv.hsstan)

# examine the Bayesian model
sampler.stats(res.cv.hsstan$final_fit)
print(projsel(res.cv.hsstan$final_fit), digits = 4)  # adding marker2
options(oldopt)  # reset options
```

Here adding `marker2` improves the model fit: substantial decrease of
KL-divergence from the full model to the submodel. Adding `marker3` does not
improve the model fit: no decrease of KL-divergence from the full model to the
submodel.


# Parallelisation

Currently `nestcv.glmnet`, `nestcv.train` and `outercv` all allow
parallelisation of the outer CV loop using `mclapply` from the `parallel`
package on unix/mac and `parLapply` on windows. This is enabled by specifying
the number of cores using the argument `cv.cores`. Since in some cases the
filtering process can be time consuming (e.g. `rf_filter`, `relieff_filter`), we
tend to recommend parallelisation of the outer CV loop over parallelisation of
the inner CV loop.

The `caret` package is set up for parallelisation using `foreach`
(https://topepo.github.io/caret/parallel-processing.html). We generally do not
recommend nested parallelisation of both outer and inner loops, although this is
theoretically feasible if you have enough cores. If *P* processors are
registered with the parallel backend, some `caret` functionality leads to *P*^2^
processes being generated. We generally find this does not lead to much speed up
once the number of processes reaches the number of physical cores, as all
processors are saturated and there is both time and memory overheads for
duplicating data and packages for each process.

Note at time of writing, there appears to be a bug in `rstan` (used by `hsstan`)
leading to it ignoring the argument `cores` and instead spawning multiple
processes as specified by the `chain` argument. This behaviour can be limited by
setting `options(mc.cores = ..)`.
