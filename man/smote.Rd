\usage{
smote(y, x, k = 5, over = NULL, yminor = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Vector of response outcome as a factor}

\item{x}{Matrix of predictors}

\item{k}{Range of KNN to consider for generation of new data}

\item{over}{Amount of oversampling of the minority class. If set to \code{NULL}
then all classes will be oversampled up to the number of samples in the
majority class.}

\item{yminor}{Optional character value specifying the level in \code{y} which is
to be oversampled. If \code{NULL}, this is set automatically to the class with
the smallest sample size.}
}
\value{
Matrix of synthesised data
}
\description{
Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm for imbalanced
classification data.
